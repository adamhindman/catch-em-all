# Pokemon 

This project is just to explore how Svelte might make some common behavior easier. In this case, pulling down and displaying a bunch of stuff from a public API. I'm using data from [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co).

To run:

With `node` already installed, 

```
npm i
```

then

```
npm run dev
```
